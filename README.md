## About

This is a simple gui wrapper around FFmpeg using electron
<br/>
The wrapper offers simple tools to set a target file size, trim options and audio merging to make it easier to share clips with friends on platforms with restricted upload sizes
<br/>

Originally this project was integrated into Better Discord as a way to ensure video files would embed correctly in Discord for previewing and ensuring that the file stayed within discords file upload constraints.
<br/>
A major update to discord changed the security policies used prevent access to necessary functions for this application to function, hence that project is deprecated.
<br/>
But due to how useful I found that application I decided to try and keep it alive in the form of an app.

### Built With

Electron and FFmpeg
<br/>
The installer is bundled by Electron Forge using Squirrel

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Package.json includes all the necessary dependencies.
<br/>
For compilation Electron, Electron-Forge and Electron-Forge-Squirrel is used
<br/>
For the program to run ffmpeg must be available on the system. This can either
<br/>
to the environment or the path for a local ffmpeg can be provided to the settings
<br/>

FFmpeg can be [downloaded](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) from here

### Installation

Download the installer from the release and run it.
<br/>
Once the installer is complete the application should open on its own otherwise search for "Simple-Transcoder" in your start menu
<br/>
If you don't have ffmpeg available on your system then refer to the Prerequisites above for installer ffmpeg

<br/>

Alternatively you can clone the repo
<br/>
Ensure npm has installed all the dependencies
<br/>
Then execute nodejs ./main.js

## Usage

Ensure you have ffmpeg installed in some form on the system either as a global (Can be checked in cmd by typing 'ffmpeg --version')
<br/>
If not, then download [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and extract the contents. Once the application window is open then under settings hit Browse and go into the ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe
<br/>

Then simply run the program, either by the start menu if installed with the installer or run the main.js file in js
<br/>
Once the window is open drag and drop a video onto the window or hit the browse button on the bottom right
<br/>
The video should load into the player
<br/>
Set the settings to what you want and set the trim options
<br/>
Once your happy with your settings hit the encode button bottom right
<br/>

The program will now transcode the video following your specifications
<br/>
The output file will appear in the same directory as the source video provided, the file will be named output.mp4
